    // if logged out, show login page

    // if logged in and authorized-- run the remaining code of controller


    //for  login page
    //You enter username,password
    //they are received by some endpoint internally provided by spring
    //spring security gets username and calls loadUserByUserName
    //if it finds user, it checks if there was a bean of password encoder --> here
    //there are two possibilities, present or not --> Bean or NoBean -->
    //if there are multiple beans of password encoder, we need to specify what bean id is to be used in securityConfig
